%%% Abstract
\abstract{%
This semestral project focuses on the development of a simulation tool for capacity planning of NB-IoT technology for smart metering system using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3). The tool will be based on a
Lena-NB module, which is designed to simulate NB-IoT network performance. By utilizing this tool, we can uncover crucial insights such as the maximum capacity of a single base station, convergence time, and transmission delay.
The the theoretical part of this thesis will provide a comprehensive overview of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies in chapter 1, covering both cellular i.e. NB-IoT and LTE Cat-M, and 
non-cellular solutions, e.g. LoRaWAN. Further, in chapter 2, a detailed description of NB-IoT 
technology will be covered, including its applications to smart metering systems. 
The practical part of this thesis will focuses on the evaluation of simulation scenarios using the LENA-NB module integrated into the NS-3 simulator. Much of the emphasis is placed on simulation time, message size, message periodicity, optimizations, EDT, signal levels. The results of the simulation scenarios will be presented in chapter 3.
